# Face-Emotions-Classification
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a deep learning model for real-time facial emotion classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically leveraging the VGG16 architecture with transfer learning. The system classifies facial expressions into three emotion categories: Happy, Sad, and Angry. 
# Project Objectives
- Design and train a deep learning model to accurately classify facial expressions into Happy, Sad, and Angry categories.
- Utilize transfer learning with the VGG16 model to improve learning efficiency.
- Evaluate model performance using real-world facial expression datasets.
- Develop a scalable and efficient model for integration into applications such as smart classrooms, healthcare monitoring, and user-adaptive interfaces.
# Dataset
- The dataset consists of three folders (Happy, Sad, Angry), each containing 100 images of facial expressions. Preprocessing steps include:
- Rescaling pixel values to the range [0, 1] for normalization.
- Applying data augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, shifting) to improve model generalization.
# Methodology
The project employs two CNN-based approaches:
- Custom CNN Model:
  - Built from scratch with multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dense layers, and dropout to reduce overfitting.
  - Uses softmax activation for multi-class classification.
- VGG16 Transfer Learning:
  - Leverages pre-trained ImageNet weights.
  - Custom layers added: Flatten, Dense (ReLU activation), Dropout, and Softmax output layer.
  - Focuses on extracting expression-specific patterns from facial images.
# Applications
- Human-Computer Interaction: Enhances user experience by responding to emotional cues in real-time.
- Mental Health Monitoring: Detects emotional distress or mood changes through automated observation.
- Smart Surveillance: Identifies abnormal behavior based on emotional expressions.
- Gaming and Virtual Reality: Dynamically adjusts gameplay based on player emotions.
- E-Learning Platforms: Personalizes learning experiences by monitoring student engagement.

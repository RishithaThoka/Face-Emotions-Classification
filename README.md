# Face-Emotions-Classification
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a deep learning model for real-time facial emotion classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically leveraging the VGG16 architecture with transfer learning. The system classifies facial expressions into three emotion categories: Happy, Sad, and Angry.
